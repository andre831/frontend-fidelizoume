## FIDELIZOU.ME FRONT-END
Hey guys. How are you?

It's all right, let's go.. ðŸš€

In this test, I was looking to create some filters on top of good development practices to get quick results.

## Tech
- React
- React Router
- Styled-Components
- Axios
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## How to use
Usage is very simple. I used two ports to define the servers (back and front).
` Backend: 3001
  Front: 3000 `

To make use, it is necessary to climb two containers. But how?
  - First time using: it is necessary to use the command ` docker-compose up --build `
  - Other times: just use `docker-compose up -d `
  - Open http://localhost:3000/
  - Be happy :D
